# BUILDING AN R PACKAGE

An exercise in creating, writing, documenting, and testing an R package.

## Overview

This exercise involves building a package that contains R functions to
read data from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administrationâ€™s
(NHTSA) [Fatality Analysis Reporting System
(FARS)](http://www.nhtsa.gov/Data/Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-\(FARS\)).

1.  Write R functions using `roxygen2` style comments
2.  Write a `vignette` to include in the package using `knitr` and R
    Markdown (`Rmd`)
3.  Write tests written using `testthat`
4.  Put package on GitHub
5.  Set up the repository so that the package can be checked and built
    on [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/) and
    [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/)

# Assessment

The R package build will be a success if:

  - The package contain the correct R file(s) under the R/ directory
  - The package contain a man/ directory with corresponding
    documentation files
  - The package contain a vignette which provides a meaningful
    description of the package and how it should be used
  - The package have tests included in the tests/ directory
  - The package has a NAMESPACE file
  - The README.md file appropriate badges
  - The build of this package passing on Travis and AppVeyor
  - The build logs for this package on Travis and AppVeyor are free of
    any errors, warnings, or notes
